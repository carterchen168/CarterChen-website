## Bio

Hello! I'm Carter, a current *EECS* major and **S4 SEED Scholar**! Tbh I'm still surprised that I'm here sometimes, but I guess that's to be expected. When I'm not in class, I love to sleep, go on my phone, and even talk with people! 

## What is SEED? ##
SEED stands for STEM Excellence through Equity and Diversity, and it's one of the programs at Berkeley!

## What is EECS? ##
EECS refers to the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science major, and it's probably one of the most prestigious majors here! We EECS people pride ourselves for our **extremely low** acceptance rate because that's the only thing we care about here. Just look at the below graph! Go bears!
