## Bio

Hello! I'm Carter, a current *EECS* major and **S4 SEED Scholar**! Tbh I'm still surprised that I'm here sometimes, but I guess that's to be expected. When I'm not in class, I love to sleep, go on my phone, and even talk with people! 

## What is SEED? ##
SEED stands for STEM Excellence through Equity and Diversity, and it's one of the programs at Berkeley!
